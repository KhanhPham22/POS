# Java POS System (Internship Project)

A simple Point of Sale (POS) desktop application built with Java Swing, following the three tier architecture. This project was developed during my internship at BTM Global as part of training.

## Features

- Product & Category Management  
- Supplier & Inventory Tracking  
- Implemented CRUD operations using Hibernate ORM in the DAO layer.
- Designed service-DAO structure for modularity and scalability.
- Used HQL and session management with Hibernate's SessionFactory.
- Applied pagination and object fetching (e.g., products in Category) via left join queries.
- Modular service-DAO architecture  
- Hibernate ORM integration  
- Unit testing with JUnit & Mockito  

## Technologies

- Java Core, Swing  
- JDBC, Hibernate  
- Oracle  
- JUnit, Mockito
- ZXing for QR code generation

## Notes

In the final phase of the internship, I also researched a real-world eCommerce system (Shopizer), analyzing its 90+ table database and API Gateway architecture.

## Status

âœ… Functional prototype for training purposes.  
ðŸš€ Future goal: Rebuild with Spring Boot & modern UI.
